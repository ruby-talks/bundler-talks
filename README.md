# Bundler-talks gem â€” now your bundler can talk

This gem using base gem [talks](https://github.com/ruby-talks/talks). You can use it if you want to hear when `bundle install` or `bundle update` ends.

Sponsored by [Evil Martians](http://evilmartians.com)

## Why?

Sometime when you have bad internet bundler works really slow. So this is works as notification of start and end in that case.

## How?

This gem using gem `talks` and overwrites some of bundler methods when you call `bundler-talks` instead of `bundle` from your command line.

### Using bundler-talks

```bash
$ gem install bundler-talks
$ bundler-talks install # instead of just `bundle install`
$ bundler-talks update # instead of just `bundle update`
$ bundler-talks exec # instead of just `bundle exec`
```

You can work with `bundler-talks update/install/exec` just the same as with original `bundle update/install/exec` - with some options and customizations:

```bash
$ bundler-talks update rails
# instead of
$ bundle update rails
```

How to customize voices for `talks` you can find in [talks](https://github.com/ruby-talks/talks) repo.
